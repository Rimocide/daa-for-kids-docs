# DAA for Students

Welcome to the **DAA for Students** project, a comprehensive tool designed to provide a visual and intuitive way to learn **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**. Our mission is to make complex algorithmic concepts more accessible and easier to understand through elegant visualizations and interactive demonstrations.

## Project Overview

The **DAA for Students** project simplifies the study of algorithms by offering dynamic, real-time visualizations that help students explore key algorithms. Whether you're tackling pathfinding algorithms, optimization problems like the Knapsack Problem, or understanding advanced sorting techniques, our project provides an engaging platform for mastering these concepts.

By transforming theoretical content into clear, interactive visuals, this project makes it easier for students to grasp complex algorithms, offering both a deep understanding of their mechanics and insights into their performance.

## Key Components

The project is organized into four core categories, each dedicated to helping students understand different classes of algorithms and their real-world applications:

### 1. **Pathfinding Algorithms**
Explore a variety of **pathfinding algorithms** through an interactive grid editor. This component allows you to visualize the workings of algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, and others. You can adjust settings to place start/end nodes, walls, and weights, and observe the real-time search process with step-by-step animations.

**Supported Algorithms:**
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Bidirectional Search
- Jump Point Search
- Segment Search

This section also includes adjustable visualization speed and an algorithm information display that details time/space complexity and optimality.

### 2. **Knapsack Problem Visualizer**
Gain insights into the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** through an interactive visualization based on the **Dynamic Programming approach**. This component allows students to experiment with customizable item weights and values, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process. It’s an invaluable tool for mastering optimization problems and understanding the principles behind dynamic programming.

### 3. **Least Common Sequence**
Visualize the process of finding the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**, a fundamental problem in dynamic programming and string matching. This interactive component walks students through the algorithm and its implementation, offering a clear visual representation of how the algorithm solves the problem.

### 4. **Huffman Encoding Visualizer**
Understand **Huffman Encoding**, a widely-used algorithm for data compression. This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, demonstrating how characters are assigned variable-length codes based on their frequencies. It also includes a visual comparison to help students understand how the encoding process minimizes the overall data size.

### 5. **Split-Merge Algorithm Visualizer**
This component offers an interactive demonstration of **external sorting algorithms**. By simulating the split and merge operations, students can see how data is processed in large-scale sorting tasks. Real-world applications and performance comparisons are included to deepen understanding of sorting in practical scenarios.

## Getting Started
