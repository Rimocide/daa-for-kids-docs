## How to File Issues

Identifying and reporting bugs or suggesting new features is a crucial form of contribution. Well-documented issues help maintainers understand the problem and facilitate solutions.

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or notice something that could be improved, please file an issue on the project's GitHub repository. Follow these guidelines to make your issue effective:

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, search the repository's existing issues to see if the problem or suggestion has already been reported.
2.  **Provide a Clear Title:** Summarize the issue concisely in the title.
3.  **Describe the Problem/Suggestion:**
    * **For Bugs:** Explain the problem in detail. Include steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, actual behavior, and information about your environment (e.g., browser, operating system, project version if applicable). Include screenshots or recordings if possible.
    * **For Feature Requests:** Clearly describe the desired feature, its potential benefits, and how it would enhance the project.
4.  **Add Labels:** If you have permissions, add relevant labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`, `documentation`) to help categorize the issue.

Filing clear and detailed issues makes it much easier for contributors to understand and address them.

## Navigating the Project Directory

To contribute code, you'll need to understand how the project's files are organized. Familiarizing yourself with the directory structure will help you locate relevant code, make changes, and add new features.

Based on the project overview you shared, here's a look at some key directories and files you'll likely encounter in the root of the repository:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── next.config.js
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
├── tsconfig.json
└── ... other configuration files
```

* **`public/`**: This directory typically contains static assets that are served directly, such as images, fonts, or the `favicon.ico`.
* **`src/`**: This is usually where the main application source code resides. Within `src/`, you would expect to find subdirectories for different parts of the application, such as components, pages, utilities, and potentially the core logic for each algorithm visualizer. This is where you'll spend most of your time if you're adding new features or fixing bugs in the visualizers.
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., build artifacts, dependency folders like `node_modules`, temporary files).
* **`README.md`**: The main documentation file that provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and basic usage information.
* **`package.json`**: This file is crucial for Node.js projects. It lists the project's dependencies, scripts for running tasks (like `npm run dev`, `npm run build`), and other project metadata.
* **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that records the exact versions of dependencies used, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.
* **`next.config.js`**: Configuration file for Next.js, a React framework often used for building web applications.
* **`postcss.config.js`**, **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration files related to styling, likely indicating the use of PostCSS and Tailwind CSS for managing styles.
* **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript, suggesting the project is written in TypeScript, which adds static typing.

Understanding this structure helps you navigate the codebase. If you want to work on the Pathfinding visualizer, you'd look within `src/` for a directory or file related to pathfinding. If you're updating dependencies, you'd modify `package.json`.

## Getting Started with Code Contributions

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Set up the Project:** Follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md) to get the project running locally.
4.  **Choose an Issue:** Look for open issues on the GitHub repository, especially those tagged as `good first issue` if you're new to contributing.
5.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b bugfix/issue-#`).
6.  **Make Changes:** Write code, update documentation, or fix bugs. Refer to the directory structure to find the relevant files.
7.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work correctly and don't introduce new issues.
8.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
9.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your repository on GitHub.
10. **Open a Pull Request:** Open a Pull Request from your branch on your fork to the main project repository. Describe your changes and reference the issue you are addressing.

Maintainers will review your Pull Request, provide feedback, and work with you to get your contribution merged.
