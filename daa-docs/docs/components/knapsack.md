# Knapsack Problem Visualizer

Welcome to the **Knapsack Problem Visualizer** module, where you can explore the classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem** through interactive visualizations. This module is designed to make understanding optimization problems and the power of dynamic programming both accessible and engaging.

## Understanding the Knapsack Problem

The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Imagine you have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity and a set of items, each with a specific weight and value. The problem is to determine which items to include in the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed the capacity, and the total value is maximized. The "0/1" signifies that you can either take an item entirely (1) or not take it at all (0) â€“ you cannot take a fraction of an item.

Our visualizer helps you grasp the core concepts and different approaches to solving this problem.

## Problem Setup

The journey begins on the **Problem Setup** page. Here, you define the parameters of your specific Knapsack problem:

* **Bag Constraints:** Set the maximum weight capacity your knapsack can hold. You can also specify an empty bag weight if relevant to your scenario.
* **Add New Item:** Define the items available to be potentially placed in the knapsack. For each item, you specify its name, weight, and monetary worth. You have the flexibility to add individual items or generate sets of items with varying characteristics (heavy, light, or mixed).

This interactive setup allows you to create custom problem instances to test different scenarios and see how algorithms perform.

## Solving the Problem

Once your problem is defined, you move to the **Solve Problem** section. Here, you choose the algorithm you want to use to find the optimal solution. While the visualizer may offer multiple approaches, the **Dynamic Programming** method is a central focus.

The dynamic programming approach to the Knapsack Problem is particularly insightful. It builds a solution iteratively by considering smaller subproblems. The visualizer beautifully showcases this process by constructing the **Dynamic Programming Table**. This table systematically records the maximum value that can be obtained for different capacities and subsets of items. The visualizer allows you to **manually traverse the steps** of filling this table, providing a clear, step-by-step understanding of how the optimal solution is derived from the solutions to subproblems. This interactive exploration of the DP table is key to demystifying this powerful technique.

## Viewing Results and Comparison

The **View Results** page presents the outcome of the chosen algorithm. You can see which items were selected for the knapsack, the total weight, and the total value achieved.

A valuable feature of this module is the ability to **Compare Both Algorithms** (typically Dynamic Programming and the Greedy approach). The visualizer will run both algorithms on your defined problem instance and present their respective results side-by-side.

Furthermore, an integrated **AI Assistant** is available throughout the module. On the comparison page, the AI Assistant provides insights into the performance of each algorithm for your specific problem instance, often highlighting why one might have performed better than the other, especially in cases where the Greedy approach fails to find the globally optimal solution that Dynamic Programming guarantees. This feature adds an extra layer of guidance and explanation to enhance your learning.
